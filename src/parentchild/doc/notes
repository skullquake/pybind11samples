Enum usage sample

Submodules may be registered using py::module, as enums are usually found in structs. The name of the submodule is set to the struct name. In this way you can refer to enums in the struct

```
example.enum.Cat
```

py::num_<> is used to export enum values, with value() and export_values() functions
